plsqlEZBatch
============

Framework for easy creation and deployment of PL/SQL batch jobs

EZ Batch allows you to create a pl/sql object (typically a package or procedure) and easily be able to do things like track job name, parameters for the job, users who should be e-mailed details of the job, start and end time, records processed, history, transactions per second, current status, historical status, etc.

I am going to add a lot more doc to this - just want to get the ball rolling here (learning GitHub as I go as well)...
